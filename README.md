# Movie Collection Client 
---
## Planning Story 
First the wireframe was made to have an idea, of how the app would look. Following the wirefram the html code was made to match the wireframe
as best as possible. The functionality was mad first, using curl was able to communicate with the corresponsing API. Proceeded to make forms where the
client would enter the data to be sent to the API. Tested out CRUD request to make sure the form fields were working. After all the functionality was
up and running, the styling of the site was then made.
